excerpt: Multiple ways to get more involved with Contentlayer.
---

There are multiple ways that you can get involved to help make Contentlayer the best way to work with content in your front end applications:

- Examples
- Bugs
- Features
- Issues
- Documentation
- Community

## Building Examples

The easiest way to get involved quickly is to help us build up real world examples. We're looking to test out Contentlayer with a number of front-end frameworks, data sources, and use cases.

After building your example, open a PR against [the website repo](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/website) after adding a reference to your example on [the examples page](/docs/other/examples).

## Squashing Bugs

Open bugs are [GitHub issues tagged with `bug`](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

Please comment on the issue before starting work to ensure that it is still relevant and that someone else isn't already working on it.

Please refer to [our contributing instructions](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for getting the project running locally.

## Adding Features

While [any open issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) is open for development, we are still in the early days. This breaking changes will be introduced regularly.

Therefore, please comment on the issue before starting work to ensure that it is still relevant, that the necessary context is included in the issue, and that someone else isn't already working on it.

Please refer to [our contributing instructions](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for getting the project running locally.

## Reporting & Monitoring Issues

Using Contentlayer and reporting issues is one of the most valuable things you can be doing as a community member in these early days.

If you run into problems or have ideas while using Contentlayer, please [open an issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues) (after checking to ensure it's not a duplicate). No bug is too small or idea too wild to begin discussing.

You can also help by jumping into active issue discussions, or even issues that haven't yet been given a direction. Any way you can keep the conversation moving helps Contentlayer.

## Writing Documentation

If you enjoy writing technical documentation, this is another great way to contribute.

While we're monitoring _some_ documentation needs through the [website's issues](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/website/issues), we're using these more for the actual website code at the moment.

The best way to get involved with documentation is to send `seancdavis29#9241` a message on Discord.

## Community Involvement

Last, but certainly not least, [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/rytFErsARm). Ask questions, share ideas, and help other community members out.
