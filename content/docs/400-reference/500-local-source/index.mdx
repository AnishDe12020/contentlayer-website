Contentlayer provides the foundation for building a structured content system using local data and content files (Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc.).

There are three main facets to building this system:

- [`makeSource`](/docs/reference/local-source/make-source) controls the entire schema definition for your application.
- [`defineDocumentType`](/docs/reference/local-source/define-document-type) defines the schema top-level document types (also known as _models_ or _content types_).
- [`defineNestedType`](/docs/reference/local-source/define-nested-type) defines the schema for data shapes that can be reused across multiple document type definitions.
