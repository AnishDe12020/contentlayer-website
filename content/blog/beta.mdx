## Thinking of Content as Data

How we handle content for the web [has evolved significantly](/blog/working-with-content-is-hard-for-developers) over the past three decades. The pattern from frameworks emerging today is to bring no opinion about how you handle content.

<ContentStack
  content={{ icons: ['markdown', 'contentful'], label: 'Local/Remote Content' }}
  processor={{ icons: ['question'], label: 'Custom Content Processor' }}
  pages={{ icons: ['react'], label: 'React Pages' }}
  decoupled={true}
/>

Tools like Next.js, Remix, SvelteKit, Astro, and others make no inference as to where your content is stored or how it is processed.

Instead, they focus their energy on providing a refined page routing and rendering system. Using Node.js, developers can process content however they want and send it as data to their pages, which are rendered using a component-based framework, like React, Vue, or Svelte.

### Content as Data is Better. But it’s Hard.

This _content as data_ approach has been a _huge_ improvement over the limitations and challenges of previous attempts to improve the developer experience when working with content.

But it’s still hard.

While it’s nice to be able to work the way you want, it’s not so great to write low-level content-processing logic when you could move faster if that work was done for you, and you could spend more time on the business logic.

### An Example with Next.js + Markdown

Let's look at a concrete example (see [source on GitHub](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks/tree/main/next-remark)). If you built a website using Next.js with local Markdown files as your content source, you’d have to develop a mechanism that converted those Markdown files into data that you could use in your Next.js pages.

<div className="my-8">
  <BetaCodeWindow.Remark />
</div>

Doing that on its own doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but it gets complicated fast. Consider that if you _really_ wanted to have the optimal developer experience, you’d have to do the following:

<BulletList>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Write markdown processing logic, including working with content-processing libraries and their plugins. This is a
    lot of base-level logic and adds a number of dependencies to your project.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Cache processed data. _Caching is hard_. _Not caching_ degrades the developer experience and build performance.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Incrementally regenerate only the content you changed to optimize rebuild/reload performance.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Account for rich and complex content associations, so that objects can live as individual content files but be
    embedded as necessary when used as data.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    For some frameworks, like Next.js, pages are not live-reloaded automatically when editing markdown content. That’s
    another mechanism to build.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    If you want to work with TypeScript and have strongly-typed data, you must generate those types manually (or build a
    thing that does it automatically).
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Implement content validations, or build an abstracted system that accepts validation settings through configuration.
  </BulletListItem>
</BulletList>

That’s _a lot_ of work.

## Contentlayer Makes Content Easy

And that’s why we built Contentlayer. **Contentlayer makes working with content easy** for developers.

<ContentStack
  content={{ icons: ['markdown', 'contentful', 'notion'], label: 'Content' }}
  processor={{ icons: ['contentlayer'], label: 'Contentlayer', className: 'text-purple-500' }}
  pages={{ icons: ['react'], label: 'Pages' }}
  decoupled={true}
/>

### How Contentlayer Works

Working with Contentlayer is a three-step process:

1. Configure your content source within a Contentlayer configuration file.

   <BetaCodeWindow.ContentlayerConfig />

2. Run Contentlayer to transform the content into data. This can be done independently, or by hooking into framework server/build processes.

   <Transform className="my-12 max-w-2xl" />

3. Use `import` to work with your content, just as you would any other data in your application.

   <BetaCodeWindow.ContentlayerNext />

### Try it Yourself

Take a look around a working example. Notice the following:

- The content is generated into a `.contentlayer/generated` directory that includes JSON content caches, exported collections of data, and automatically-generated types.
- The `pages/[[...slug]].tsx` page brings in the content directly, manipulates it as needed, and passes it onto the page component.

Try it! Make a change to one of the markdown files in the `content` directory. Notice that the content in the browser is automatically refreshed (quickly) and the JSON cache is updated for that piece of content.

<div className="my-24 xl:-mx-40">
  <Playground
    githubRepo="contentlayerdev/next-contentlayer-example/tree/stackblitz-demo"
    openFile="posts/change-me.md"
  />
</div>

## Benefits of Contentlayer

Contentlayer makes working with content a great experience for developers by providing the following benefits:

<BulletList>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Content just works**: Gone are the days of writing low-level content-processing logic. Instead, you set the rules
    and the content _just works_.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **TypeScript Support**: TypeScript type definitions are automatically generated for every piece of content.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    <div className="mb-4">Validations are built-in and configurable.</div>
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    Content builds are cached, and content is incrementally regenerated, doing only the necessary work when you update
    content in development mode.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    The browser will automatically reload after changing content for those frameworks that support live reloading.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    It's easier to scale your system to account for complex content relationships.
  </BulletListItem>
</BulletList>

### Contentlayer is Fast at Every Stage of a Project

These benefits make Contentlayer fast at every stage of project development.

<BulletList>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Build:** The server boots quickly, content is incrementally regenerated, and live reloading unlocked.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Test:** Because builds are faster, CI and CD finish quicker, which means your content gets into production sooner.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Deploy:** More processing is done at build time, including rendering markdown, minimizing the work done on the
    client. This improves your Lighthouse scores and makes your site faster for your users.
  </BulletListItem>
</BulletList>

### Build Performance Comparison vs DIY and Gatsby

We put our claims to the test and [built a simple benchmark study](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks) that compared a Next.js site with 1k markdown content files to the same site using a DIY content method. We then built the same site with Gatsby.

In both cases, the Contentlayer site was nearly **twice as fast**. Even when we tested against warm builds, where the frameworks could make use of cached artifacts from previous builds, **Contentlayer was still nearly twice as fast**.

<BenchmarkResults />

### Works for projects of any size

As we’ve seen, Contentlayer tends to work best alongside frameworks with an open content model. We’ve focused on Next.js up until this point, but plan to investigate support for Remix, SvelteKit, Nuxt, and more.

Beyond the framework, Contentlayer can stand up to complex content structures, while also serving projects at every stage. It’s simple enough to get started that you’d find great benefit in working with Contentlayer for your personal site or blog.

And it _really_ starts to feel like the right decision as content structures become more nested or complex, like in typical documentation sites. And it can continue to scale with any site as its complexity grows.

When starting a project with opinionated content tooling, there is always a risk of outgrowing those opinions and needing to switch to something more flexible. Conentlayer makes the flexibility of modern open content frameworks accessible to projects of any size.

## The Future of Content(layer)

We’re just getting started.

We will continue to add new content sources — Contentful is experimental, with Notion is coming up quickly behind it — and investigate fully supporting additional modern frameworks. We’ll also be giving much attention to image processing.
