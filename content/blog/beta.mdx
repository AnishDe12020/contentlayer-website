<TLDR>

Working with content data (e.g. Markdown files or CMS) is a surprisingly difficult and laborious task when developing modern sites (e.g. with Next.js). **Contentlayer is a content SDK** that to aims to make content easy for developers with a focus on great DX and performance.

We're very excited to officially release Contentlayer in beta after many months of alpha testing and already being used in over 300 projects.

## Motivation: Thinking of Content as Data

How we handle content for the web [has evolved significantly](/blog/working-with-content-is-hard-for-developers) over the past three decades. The pattern from frameworks emerging today is to bring no opinion about how you handle content.

<ContentStack
  content={{ icons: ['markdown', 'contentful'], label: 'Local/Remote Content' }}
  processor={{ icons: ['question'], label: 'Custom Content Processor' }}
  pages={{ icons: ['react'], label: 'React Pages' }}
  decoupled={true}
/>

Tools like Next.js, Remix, SvelteKit, Astro, and others make no inference as to where your content is stored or how it is processed.

Instead, they focus their energy on providing a refined page routing and rendering system. Using Node.js, developers can process content however they want and send it as data to their pages, which are rendered using a component-based framework, like React, Vue, or Svelte.

### Content as Data is Better. But it’s Hard.

This _content as data_ approach has been a _huge_ improvement over the limitations and challenges of previous attempts to improve the developer experience when working with content.

But it’s still hard.

While it’s nice to be able to work the way you want, it’s not so great to write low-level content-processing logic when you could move faster if that work was done for you, and you could spend more time on the business logic.

### DIY Example with Next.js + Markdown

Let's look at a concrete example (see [source on GitHub](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks/tree/main/next-remark)) without Contentlayer. If you built a website using Next.js with local Markdown files as your content source, you’d have to develop a mechanism that converted those Markdown files into data that you could use in your Next.js pages.

<div className="my-8">
  <BetaCodeWindow.Remark />
</div>

Doing that on its own doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but it gets complicated fast. Consider that if you _really_ wanted to have a reliable setup and good developer experience, you’d have to do the following:

<BulletList>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Write markdown processing logic, including working with content-processing libraries and their plugins. This is a
    lot of base-level logic and adds a number of dependencies to your project.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Cache processed data. _Caching is hard_. _Not caching_ degrades the developer experience and build performance.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Incrementally regenerate only the content you changed to optimize rebuild/reload performance.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Account for rich and complex content associations, so that objects can live as individual content files but be
    embedded as necessary when used as data.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    For some frameworks, like Next.js, pages are not live-reloaded automatically when editing markdown content. That’s
    another mechanism to build.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    If you want to work with TypeScript and have strongly-typed data, you must generate those types manually (or build a
    thing that does it automatically).
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="cross">
    Implement content validations, or build an abstracted system that accepts validation settings through configuration.
  </BulletListItem>
</BulletList>

That’s _a lot_ of work.

## Introducing Contentlayer

And that’s why we built Contentlayer. **Contentlayer makes working with content easy** for developers.

<ContentStack
  content={{ icons: ['markdown', 'contentful', 'notion'], label: 'Content' }}
  processor={{ icons: ['contentlayer'], label: 'Contentlayer', className: 'text-purple-500' }}
  pages={{ icons: ['react'], label: 'Pages' }}
  decoupled={true}
/>

### How Contentlayer Works

After installing Contentlayer via `npm i contentlayer next-contentlayer` you're ready to go:

1. First you need to tell Contentlayer where your content lives and which format and structure it has. There are different kinds of content sources - here we're using local Markdown files.

   <BetaCodeWindow.ContentlayerConfig />

2. Run Contentlayer to transform the content into data. This can be done independently, or by hooking into framework server/build processes.

   <Transform className="my-12 max-w-2xl" />

3. Use `import` to work with your content, just as you would with any other data or code in your application.

   <BetaCodeWindow.ContentlayerNext />

### Try it Yourself

Take a look around a working example. Notice the following:

- The content is generated into a `.contentlayer/generated` directory that includes JSON content caches, exported collections of data, and automatically-generated types.
- The `pages/[[...slug]].tsx` page brings in the content directly, manipulates it as needed, and passes it onto the page component.

Try it! Make a change to one of the markdown files in the `content` directory. Notice that the content in the browser is automatically refreshed (quickly) and the JSON cache is updated for that piece of content.

<div className="my-24 xl:-mx-40">
  <Playground
    githubRepo="contentlayerdev/next-contentlayer-example/tree/stackblitz-demo"
    openFile="posts/change-me.md"
  />
</div>

## Benefits of Contentlayer

Contentlayer aims to provide a great developer experience (DX) through the following features:

<BulletList>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Content just works**: Gone are the days of writing low-level content-processing logic. Instead, you set the rules
    and the content _just works_.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **TypeScript Support**: Auto-generated TypeScript type definitions every document type.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    <div className="mb-4">**Content validation:** Content is validated automatically with helpful error messages.</div>
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Caching**: Content builds are cached and incrementally regenerated - doing only the minimal amount of work
    necessary when changing your content.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Live reload**: The browser will automatically reload after changing content for those frameworks that support live
    reloading.
  </BulletListItem>
  <BulletListItem type="check">
    **Flexible content modeling**: Contentlayer allows you to structure your content in a flexible and powerful way.
  </BulletListItem>
</BulletList>

### Build Performance Comparison: Contentlayer vs DIY and Gatsby

We put our claims to the test and [built a simple benchmark study](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer-benchmarks) that compared a Next.js site with 1,000+ markdown content files to the same site using a DIY content processing method. We then built the same site with Gatsby.

<div className="my-8 space-y-4">
  <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/RL2t7es.png" alt="Contentlayer Performance Comparison" width="2560" height="1200" />
  <div className="flex w-full justify-center text-sm text-slate-300 dark:text-slate-500">
    Smaller is better/faster. Used machine: [GitHub
    Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)
  </div>
</div>

In both cases, using Contentlayer was nearly **twice as fast**. Even when we tested against warm builds, where the frameworks could make use of cached artifacts from previous builds, Contentlayer was still nearly twice as fast.

## The Future of Content(layer)

This beta release of Contentlayer marks an important milestone in the [roadmap of the project](/docs/other/roadmap) - but we're just getting started. Over the coming months leading up to a stable 1.0 release we're aiming to accomplish the following:

- Add support for more content sources (e.g. [Contentful](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/173), [Notion](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/174), ...) and even supporting [multiple content sources](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/84) in a single project
- Providing seamless integrations for more site frameworks (such as [Vite](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/179), [Remix](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/169), [Astro](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/171), ...)
- Validate and evolve the core abstractions of Contentlayer to avoid breaking changes after the 1.0 release
